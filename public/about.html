<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello there! <br />
  My name is Thant. I am 27 years old and originally a doctor from Myanmar.</p>

<p>I discovered my passion for coding not long ago after attending Code in Place from Stanford University, which is a great free beginner coding course that everyone should join. 
  Currently, I am improving my knowledge on Web Development by attending Angela Yu's course on Udemy.
  I am hoping to change my career to IT and coding soon.</p>
